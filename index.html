          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Faris Ahmed and I am currently a rising senior at Texas A&M University pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and web development. I am interested in learning about new technologies and applying them to find solutions to real world problems. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my career and education, you'll find me at the gym, playing basketball (go Lakers!), and playing video games. Photography is another creative outlet that I cherish, as it allows me to capture beautiful moments and tell stories through images. 
            My journey into the world of programming began in high school, and I've been honing my skills since then. I am excited to apply my knowledge to this internship and gain experience in web development! Iâ€™m dedicated to becoming a well-rounded software engineer, specializing in web development. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive on the challenges and problem-solving opportunities that programming offers, and I am eager to contribute my knowledge and skills to develop cutting-edge applications and websites.
            While gaining a strong foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - I am continually trying to explore new frameworks to expand my knowledge and expertise. I would like to be able to write clean and efficient code that matches the industry's best practices.
            I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to collaborating with talented professionals to create innovative solutions.
